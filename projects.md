## Prototype #1 -- requirements

Stakeholder feedback and plan...

* Submit a one-page (maximum) PDF describing stakeholder feedback on prototype #1 and your plan for prototype #2
  * Include your stakeholder's job title
    * Include your stakeholder's name in a document published on the web **only** if you have their permission
* Your submission should include 3 summary statements:
  * 1. Describe the main features of your prototype that you showed to your stakeholder.
    * If you provide detailed markdown in your notebook for prototype #1, then summarize it briefly here.
  * 2. Describe the stakeholder feedback
    * Likewise, this should summarize any detail in your notebook for prototype #1.
  * 3. Proposed plan
    * This is the an important component of the PDF that you submit on 14 November
    * Summarize the main findings from your stakeholder feedback and your planned revisions resulting from the feedback.
    * Answer the question: How is your "story" evolving based on the feedback you've obtained so far?
* Include a URL for the prototype discussed with your stakeholder in your PDF.
  * Ideally, you would use the URL that you submitted on 7 November.
  * If it's different then make that clear.  The objective here is to understand the feedback and your planned response.
