## Coding

* Create a github account, unless you have one already
  * Verify that you can use your github account to authenticate on [observablehq.com](http://observablehq.com).
* Follow the [gh-pages tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) to set up your own gh-pages site
  * If you're new to git and github: You may want to use "Github Desktop" as your git client.
  * If you're already familiar with github, then you may want to use the command line.
  * Note: If you're having any trouble at all, post a question on Piazza.
* Extra credit: Add a little [CSS styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) of your choice.
  * Be creative! Learn about CSS. But whatever you do, keep it simple!
  * If you're new to CSS, this [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/Getting_started) may give you ideas.
  * Optional: If you know CSS, then you might consider a [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) demo
  * Document your code so that other students can understand how it works
