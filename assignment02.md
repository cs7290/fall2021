# ASSIGNMENT 02 -- Plot

* The assignment (below) includes coding and reading
* Due: Midnight on Sunday, 26 Sep 
  * Check Canvas for submission details
* Learning goals
  * Practice getting data into Observable
  * Simple and quick charts with Plot
  * Simple embedding
* Provide feedback -- especially if you think we're going too fast!!
  * Ask questions in class or with piazza or during office hours

## Coding

* Create an Observable notebook
  * Get some data into the notebook via an API or an attached file
  * It should be tabular data such as CSV (or easily made into tabular data)
  * The data can be something that you've worked with in the past or are thinking about for a term project
  * It must be clean and readily accessible -- you do NOT want to spend a lot of time accessing cleaning, organizing
  * If you're not sure what to use for data, contact me -- either office hours or arrange a time to connect on Teams
* Visualize the data with [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot)
  * Something basic is fine.
  * In your notebook, describe the purpose/meaning of the visualization (in a couple sentences)
  * Make sure you cite any and all references that you used (data sources, publications, notebooks, websites, etc.)
* Embed the visualization in your gh-pages site
  * Create a new page on your site or use the page that you created in Assignment #1 last week
  * Add some descriptive text that explains to the reader what it is they're looking at and why it's interesting.
  * Note: the audience for your website may be different than the audience for your Observable notebook
* This entire assignment need not take a lot of coding. 
  * Extra Credit: Major awards for 3 submissions (criteria: clean well-documented code, compelling story & visualization)
