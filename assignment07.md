# Assignment 07

Due: Sunday, 31 October

* Finish turning [Empty Brush Selection](https://observablehq.com/@d3/empty-brush-selection) into a 2-handle range input.
  * First, reimplement the changes from class (see the solution to exercises).
  * Implement event listeners that style the slider consistent with mouse-event effects on built-in range inputs.
    * This event-driven styling includes hover, mousedown, etc. 
    * Note that "drag" with mouse/finger is not a built-in event, it's a combination of such events.
  * Make the size of the range slider consistent with the size of built-in range inputs.
  * Turn the chart into a view that reports the selected values
  * The default range is [0,1] -- make this configurable with, for example, `range = [0, 100]`
* Extra credit:
  * Add a label
  * Report the min/max values as part of the display
* See Canvas about submission detail and deadline.
