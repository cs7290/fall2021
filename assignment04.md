# ASSIGNMENT 04 -- Mini-Project

* Due: Midnight on Monday, 11 Oct
  * Check Canvas for submission details
* Data
  * Find a dataset that you consider interesting.
  * It may be publicly-available data, or something you've worked on in a course or project.
  * You must have permission to use the data and share results. 
  * If you want ideas, look in [Introduction to Data](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introduction-to-data)
    * The section on APIs lists several places to look.
* Stakeholder
  * **Identify a stakeholder who is willing to engage with you on a project related to the data.**
  * **If you're having trouble identifying a stakeholder, then here are some options for you to consider...**
    * [Greater Portland Council of Governments (GPCOG)](https://www.gpcog.org/)
      * [Project Stinky](https://github.com/ds5110/stinky) -- this is the github repo that was developed last summer.
      * The stakeholders listed in the README.md will be working with us.
      * There are several things that could be done as follow-on to this project. I can help you with that.
    * [Let's Get Ready](https://letsgetready.org/)
      * There's a survey dataset that needs to be cleaned and visualized. I'm putting together a github repo for this.
      * The Director of Data and Evaluation from Let's Get Ready will be working with us.
      * This is a Northeastern University [Serving-Learning](https://communityengagement.northeastern.edu/programs/service-learning/) partner.
  * **If you want to work on one of these projects, then you've identified the stakeholder! That part's done.**
    * Don't contact them yet. I'll work with you on that.
* EDA
  * Ideally, these mini-projects could turn into term projects for the course, but you can do a little EDA right now.
    * Term projects will involve teams of ~3 students.
    * We can talk about creating teams later.
    * For now, it's okay to work individually on something of interest to you.
  * Visualization
    * Use Observable Plot to visualize the data in an Observable notebook.
    * Tell a story with the data -- that story can a term-project **proposal**.
* Extra credit
  * Make it an interactive [Dashboard](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/dashboard)
  * Although it's not necessary, you can use this mini-project as a proposal for your term project.
    * If multiple students choose the same stakeholder/dataset, that's okay -- we'll coordinate later.
* Provide feedback
  * Ask questions if you want to learn more about the stakeholder projects.
  * Ask questions if you think we're going too fast!!
  * Ask questions in class or with piazza or during office hours (on Teams, Fridays, 2-4 ET) or by appointment on Teams.
