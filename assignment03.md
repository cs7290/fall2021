# ASSIGNMENT 03

* The assignment (below) includes coding and reading
* Due: Midnight on Sunday, 3 Oct
  * Check Canvas for submission details
* Learning goals
  * Introduction to animation
  * Practice with the Observable Plot API
* Ask questions -- especially if you're stuck or you think we're going too fast!!
  * Ask questions in class or with piazza or during office hours

## Coding

Use a technique from [Animation Loops](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/animation-loops) 
to animate the [SVG Circle](https://observablehq.com/d/991595f4b70d9f06) 
(the solution to Assignment #2)
so that the circle bounces off the walls of the SVG.

Note that [Animation Loops](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/animation-loops) doesn't use SVG.
It is animating a circle on a [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) context 
that's created with [DOM.context3d()](https://github.com/observablehq/stdlib#DOM_context2d).
We haven't dealt with canvas (yet).
The assignment is to animate the SVG circle that we worked with in class.
Hint: The most straightforward assignment solution 
involves use of [now](https://github.com/observablehq/stdlib/blob/main/README.md#now) in Option 3.

## Reading

* [Plot Exploration: Weather](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-exploration-weather)

Beware of a possible quiz on the reading.
