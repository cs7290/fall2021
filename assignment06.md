# Assignment 06

Due: Sunday, 24 October

* Finish Lab02 from last week and see Canvas about submission and deadline.
* Let me know about your desired Term Project.
  * If you're unsure, set up a time to connect with me on Teams.
* Create a "portfolio piece" for your gh-pages site, based on your mini-project notebook.
  * A "portfolio piece" includes a story and the relevant chart(s) that help tell the story -- it doesn't need to be long.
  * Some of you have done this already, in which case you're good to go.
  * I have feedback on your projects. If you'd like to discuss, then set up a time to connect with me on Teams.
