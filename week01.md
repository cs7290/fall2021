# Week 1 -- Day 1

## Overview (this week)

* Day 1
  * Syllabus (Canvas)
  * Examples (from PDF)
  * Course goals & non-goals
  * Evaluation
  * Github Pages (Assignment)
  * Introducing & experimenting with the modern browser (dev console and the DOM)
* Day 2
  * Python and Python Data Viz compared to JavaScript/D3
  * Jupyter compared to Observable
  * Demo & in-class exercises -- reusing code with Observable

## Course goals

You will learn how to use cutting-edge web technologies to...

* Tell a story with data
  * Test a hypothesis
  * Communicate insights
  * Make an (convincing) argument
* Create custom visualizations with the most modern technologies
  * term project working on a team
  * geospatial data
  * animations
* Create your own website/porfolio
  * portfolio, blog, or whatever you'd like
  * we'll use the site to provide context for the things we'll do in Observable

## Course non-goals

The goal is not to...

* Turn you into a front-end web developer
  * ...although you'll take a step in that direction
  * You will learn how to contribute in a team with front-end developers
  * Web devs use a relatively complex suite of tools and workflows, but you'll learn the basics
* Turn you into an open-source software developer
  * ...although you'll take a step in that direction
  * You will learn how to adapt examples and debug the code that you write
  * We'll also look under the hood at some of the more popular open source projects
* Spend time learning GUIs for proprietary charting packages
  * ...although we'll discuss them and put them in context
  * You will learn how to create the anything they can, but you'll use open-source libraries and write code.
  * With code, you can create the kinds of visualizations that proprietary charting packages only dream about.

## Evaluation

* Quizzes or midterm/final exams?? Concensus Answer: Quizzes (based on readings)
  * Part of "Class Participation"
* Short (individual) projects
* Term (team) project

## The modern browser

A look under the hood...

* Learning Goals
  * From "View Source" to the browser console
  * Introduce the DOM
  * Introduce MDN - mention stackoverflow and W3Schools
* The Console
  * Show how it can be simple (https://pbogden.github.io/with_style.html) -- I wrote this
  * Show how it can be autogenerated (https://pbogden.github.io) -- Github converted it from a README.md
  * Show how it can be complex, even for an "apparently" simple web page (google.com)
  * Manipulate the DOM from the console -- introduce MDN as an authoritative resource.
    * [The DOM (Document Object Model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) -- MDN
    * EXERCISE (in-class): Remove the heading from [my page](https://pbogden.github.io/with_style.html)
      * [`document.getElementById()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
      * [`Element.remove()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/remove)
    * EXERCISE (in-class): Remove the Google logo from google.com -- without removing the rest of the content

## Observable notebooks

* Learning goals
  * Introduce to Observable notebooks
  * Get a high-level perspective of how it works
  * Develop interest in the range of possibilities
* [Introduction to Observable](https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/introduction) -- collection
  * [A Taste of Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/a-taste-of-observable)
  * [Introduction to data](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introduction-to-data)
    * [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
* [Notebooks & Cells](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/notebooks-cells) -- tutorial video
  * A nice introduction for those who are already familiar with JavaScript
  * On day 2, we'll take a Python perspective
