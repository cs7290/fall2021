# Lab 02

EDA with pet adoption data

* To access the data, use `import {petAdoptions} from "7ffd902947c09896"`
* [Poor Dogs](https://observablehq.com/d/9bb9f29652b5d52e) -- my notebook with solutions

## EXERCISES

0. How much data is there (e.g., # of rows, and why)?
1. Get the total number of canine adoptions by year (consider using d3.group)
2. Use the result from the previous step to print (with commas for thousands) the total number for all years.
3. Create a grouped bar chart -- bar chart shows each year, grouped by state
